I've been learning Jekyll for a week and this is my first blog. I'm studying Computer Engineering in Gazi University. It' s my career goal to develop myself more and more everday. My main intention is improving myself at software technologies. I'm learning about Web Development recently. I want to increase my blog posts. I'm trying to learn React these days.

I did two projects to learn react, you can browse their links.

- [First Project](https://github.com/yigiterdev/react-project-for-learning)
- [Second Project](https://github.com/yigiterdev/tic-tac-toewithReact)
